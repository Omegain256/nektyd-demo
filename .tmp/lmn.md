### Client Management

Capture and organize every lead and property in _one place_. Track follow-ups, notes, and site details so handoffs are clean and response times drop. LMN also centralizes messages with clients, so you deliver timely updates and a professional communication experience that builds trust.

![LMN cms software](https://granum.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/lmnoverview-clientmanagement-768x432.webp)

### Budget-Based Estimating

Build your bids from your LMN budget, that includes labor, materials, equipment, and overhead so every proposal is priced to hit target margin. Clients receive clear, professional estimates digitally, reinforcing credibility and making approvals easier.

[Explore Estimating Feature](https://granum.com/lmn/estimating/)

### Automated Scheduling

Drag-and-drop jobs onto the calendar and route crews in minutes. Instantly adjust for weather, delays, or call-backs without breaking the day. With digital schedules pushed to the field, crews stay aligned and jobs finish on time.

[Explore Scheduling Feature](https://granum.com/lmn/scheduling/)

### Job & Time Tracking

Record crew time and production directly from the LMN mobile app, _available in both English and Spanish_. The app includes offline mode for reliability in the field, and an interface designed for quick, easy clock-ins. Payroll stays accurate, and job records are complete even in low-connectivity areas.

### Invoicing & Payment

Generate invoices from approved work and send them digitally for a professional client experience. Accept online payments fast and handle change orders or partials without complexity. Quicker payment cycles improve cash flow and make your business look polished and modern.

[Explore LMN Pay](https://granum.com/lmn/lmn-pay-powered-by-stripe/)

### Job Costing & Reporting

See estimate vs. actuals while the job is live, not weeks later. Catch overruns early and adjust before profit slips away. Historical cost and production data accumulate into a more disciplined, confident bidding process.
